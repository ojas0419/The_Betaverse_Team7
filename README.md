# The_Betaverse_Team7
Submission for TezAsia Hackathon 

Like the Beta of any application, the Betaverse is constantly changing, while retaining all features and the level of security and independence that is inherent to decentralised applications. This eternal change essentially puts this project into a Beta of itself, ergo the name.

The present demonstration consists of a 3D Unity Project that can be rendered on browsers (and extended native PC, APK on possible future implementations) using Webgl. It communicates with the React App using the Unity-WebGL-React integration package, allowing us to add smart contracts and trigger the same. 

Final project push at 12 noon, 13th August IST
